# üîß Railway Build Error - FIXED

## Problem
Railway detected both Node.js (package.json) and Python, tried to build Next.js frontend, which failed due to missing dependencies during build.

## Solution
Created `nixpacks.toml` to force Railway to deploy ONLY the Python API.

## Files Added/Updated

### New Files
1. **`nixpacks.toml`** - Tells Railway: "This is a Python project, ignore Node.js"
2. **`.railwayignore`** - Excludes Next.js files from deployment

### Updated Files
- `railway.json` - Cleaned up configuration
- `DEPLOY.md` - Updated file list

## üöÄ Deploy Now

```bash
# Commit the new configuration
git add .
git commit -m "Fix Railway build - deploy Python API only"
git push origin master
```

Railway will now:
‚úÖ Detect Python 3.11 via `nixpacks.toml`
‚úÖ Install dependencies from `requirements.txt`
‚úÖ Skip Next.js build completely
‚úÖ Start FastAPI with `uvicorn main:app`

## Expected Build Output

```
[INFO] Using Python 3.11
[INFO] Installing requirements.txt
[INFO] Starting application...
[INFO] Uvicorn running on 0.0.0.0:$PORT
```

## üìù Important Notes

- **Frontend (Next.js)**: Deploy separately on Vercel
- **Backend (FastAPI)**: Deploy on Railway (this deployment)
- **Separation**: Frontend and backend are now independent services

## Next Steps After Successful Deployment

1. Get Railway URL: `https://your-app.railway.app`
2. Add environment variables in Railway dashboard:
   - `TTS_API_BASE_URL`
   - `ASR_API_BASE_URL`
3. Update frontend to use Railway API URL
4. Test at: `https://your-app.railway.app/docs`

**Status**: Ready to deploy! Push to trigger rebuild.
